    <h2>About Myself</h2>
    <p> 
        I'm a Web Programming student living in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I've created art as a hobby for most 
        of my life, and transitioned to commission work durring highschool. I work comfortably in multiple
        mediums such as: pencil, paint, and digital media. My design sensibilities are heavily inspired by 
        the bright and exaggerated art found in animation.
